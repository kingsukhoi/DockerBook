## What is Docker

This sums up Docker.

Docker is a way to package and environment and the app, isolate it from your computer, and run it the same way every time.

Docker is similar to a virtual machines like VMWare, in the sense that the processes that run in the container don't know about the system it runs on. However, how Docker and VMWare go about doing that is different, and out of scope for this document.
